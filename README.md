# AI Art Networks around Ghibli Style Content

This study employs Social Network Analysis to investigate the emergent communities
driving the creation and dissemination of AI-generated Studio Ghibli-style artwork. We
propose a novel multi-layered analytical framework incorporating three network types:
user engagement networks, prompt semantic networks, and image similarity networks.
User networks are modeled as bipartite graphs and analyzed using the Louvain algorithm
with modularity optimization, revealing distinct creator-amplifier behavioral patterns.
Prompt networks, processed with Leiden clustering on BERT embeddings, uncover
thematic communities centered around Ghibli-characteristic elements. Image networks
analyzed through K-means clustering demonstrate how stylistic consistency influences
content virality. Our quantitative results show statistically significant correlations between
network centrality measures and content propagation metrics. Temporal analysis
reveals community evolution patterns following power-law distributions. This research
contributes to computational creativity literature by mapping the socio-technical dynamics
of AI art communities and provides methodological innovations for analyzing creative
digital ecosystems structured around shared aesthetic frameworks.
